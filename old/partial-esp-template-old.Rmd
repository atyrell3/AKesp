# Executive Summary {-}

Short description of ESP process and justification for conducting an ESP for this stock (this will likely be consistent text for all partial ESPs)
Please refer to the last full ESP document for further information regarding the ecosystem and socioeconomic linkages for this stock (Citation, available online at https://...pdf).

## Summary of Changes in Assessment Inputs {-}

### Changes in the Metric or Indicator Data {-}

Brief summary of any changes to metric or indicator data from the most recent full ESP document. This may occur if you had a placeholder metric or indicator and were waiting for a more suited proxy to be finalized and became available during a partial update year. 

### Changes in the Indicator Analysis {-}

Brief summary of any changes to the indicator analysis from the most recent full ESP document. Generally there would not be changes in a partial ESP unless you were requested to make changes by the Plan Team, SSC, or Council or if the methods changed slightly for the ESPs based on recommendations from the Plan Team, SSC, or Council (e.g. addition of the traffic light score) 

## Summary of Results {-}

Brief literature review on any new ecosystem or socioeconomic indicators explored for stock since the last full ESP

### Indicator Suite {-}

List of ecosystem indicators ordered by category (physical, zooplankton, larvae and young-of-the-year, juvenile, and adult). If the indicator occurred in the last full ESP, then just list the name of the indicator and reference the full ESP document. If the indicator was a replacement and is new, then provide a description as in the full document. 

List of socioeconomic indicators ordered by category (fishery performance, economic, community). If the indicator occurred in the full ESP, then just list the name of the indicator and reference the full ESP document. If the indicator was a replacement and is new, then provide a description as in the full document. 

Graph of indicator time series panel, same as in full document

### Indicator Analysis  {-}

Short description of three indicator analysis stages, 1) traffic light test, 2) importance test, 3) linked model test. If you only have one or two tests, just include the descriptions for those. 

#### Stage 1: Traffic Light Test {-}

Short description of test, reference to full ESP for more details 

Summary of indicator changes from last full ESP, current trends 

Report scores by category (if applicable) and overall ecosystem and socioeconomic indicators. 

#### Stage 2: Importance Test {-}

Short description of test, reference to full ESP for more details

Report update in importance results from last full ESP

#### Stage 3: Linked Model Test {-}

Short description of ecosystem linked model and reference to model development report or paper

Updated performance table with comparison to current author recommended model, where applicable

If the performance table has not been completed but there is an ecosystem linked model in development, just describe here and state the plan for results to be presented in future ESP. 

Table of indicators including short description, source or contact, recent trend (plus, minus, average), color for current year corresponding to relationship to stock (good=blue, stable=white, poor=red) and then category and overall simple score

Updated importance run output, where applicable

Updated comparison table for ecosystem linked assessment model run, where applicable

## Ecosystem Considerations {-}

- Updated summary conclusions from full metric assessment
- Updated summary conclusions from full indicator assessment

## Economic Considerations {-}

- Updated summary conclusions from full metric assessment
- Updated summary conclusions from full indicator assessment

## Data Gaps and Future Research Priorities {-}

Description of data gaps, future priorities for ecosystem and socioeconomic research that would support future versions of the ESP

## Responses to SSC and Plan Team Comments on ESPs in General {-}

List of general ESP comments since last full ESP, not required to respond but may if can do in a short paragraph or just state will respond in next full ESP

## Responses to SSC and Plan Team Comments Specific to this ESP {-}

List of stock-specific ESP comments since last full ESP, not required to respond but may if can do in a short paragraph or just state will respond in next full ESP

# Acknowledgements  {-}

Include contributors, internal reviewers, Groundfish/Crab Plan Teams, SSC, AFSC personnel and divisions, other state, national, international contributing agencies

# Literature Cited  {-}

Include reference numbers at the end of the citations from the life history table

Include DOI or links to papers where possible

\newpage

# Tables {-}

             cap = tabs$caption[i])
}
```

\newpage

# Figures {-}
