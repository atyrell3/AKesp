### Create ESP templates and reports

1. This package can create templates for ESP report cards. Up-to-date data is pulled from AKFIN and processed into figures and tables. The text is populated with default information and placeholders. The report is knit to Word, where it can be edited.

2. This package can create templates for partial and full ESP reports. After the user fills out these templates, this package can knit a final Word report, including pulling in figures and tables.
